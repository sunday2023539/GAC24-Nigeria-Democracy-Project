GAC24: Final Project: Nigeria Democracy  

1. Introduction 

This final project, structured as an ArcGIS StoryMap, sought to provide a comprehensive, geographically informed analysis of the state of democracy in Nigeria. Utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the study aimed to move beyond purely statistical reporting to visualize and interpret the spatial dimensions of Nigeria’s democratic experience. The core challenge addressed was the persistent complexity, regional polarization, and vulnerability of the democratic process, particularly in relation to deep-seated socio-economic and ethnic divides. The StoryMap functions as a dynamic tool for stakeholders, policymakers, and citizens to visualize how electoral behavior, political stability, and development indicators intersect across Nigeria’s diverse geographical landscape. 

 

2. Methods 

The methodology was centered on the principles of geospatial data analysis and visualization using the ArcGIS platform. 

Data Acquisition 

The project relied on integrating multiple publicly sourced datasets, which were then prepared for spatial analysis. Key data layers likely included: 

Electoral Data: Historical and recent geo-referenced election results (e.g., Presidential and Gubernatorial) aggregated at the State and Local Government Area (LGA) levels, focusing on voter turnout percentages and party dominance. 

Socio-Economic Data: Census-derived demographic indicators (population density, literacy rates) and socio-economic development metrics (poverty incidence, infrastructure access) to establish context. 

Conflict and Security Data: Location data for instances of electoral violence, internal security threats, or politically motivated unrest, allowing for a spatial risk assessment. 

Geospatial Analysis and Visualization 

Once the data was standardized and cleaned, the following primary analytical techniques were applied within the GIS environment: 

Thematic Mapping: Choropleth maps were the main visualization tool, used to depict the intensity or distribution of single variables (e.g., high vs. low voter turnout) across administrative units. 

Spatial Correlation: Overlays were used to examine the geographic relationship between variables—for instance, mapping poverty concentration against low voter registration areas to test correlation. 

Narrative Flow: The StoryMap format itself served as the methodological framework for presentation, guiding the user sequentially through the data, analysis, and interpretation to build a cohesive narrative. 

 

3. Results and Key Findings 

The geospatial analysis effectively highlighted the profound regional nuances and deep divisions characterizing Nigeria's democratic process. 

Political Polarization and Regional Blocks: The maps consistently demonstrated clear spatial clustering of political support, confirming the deep entrenchment of voting along geo-political and ethno-religious lines. Specific regions showed overwhelmingly homogenous support for particular parties, which significantly influences national coalition-building and governance. 

Development and Participation Linkages: A strong, inverse spatial correlation was observed between various positive democratic indicators (e.g., high voter registration and participation rates) and negative socio-economic indicators (e.g., high poverty or low literacy). Areas with lower indices of human development tended to exhibit more volatile or less robust democratic engagement. 

Vulnerability Mapping: By mapping instances of security incidents and political violence, the project successfully created a visualization of geographical vulnerability. The results indicated that the spatial occurrence of these events often clusters around contested borders, major transportation corridors, or areas with pre-existing communal conflicts, providing a crucial layer of context for election monitoring and security planning. 

In summary, the "Nigeria Democracy" StoryMap offered compelling visual evidence that the future stability of Nigeria's democracy is fundamentally tied to the government's ability to address deep-seated regional disparities and bridge the geographic gap between political participation and socio-economic development.
